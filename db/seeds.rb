# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


# 创建Team基础数据
# teams = [
#     "生产",
#     "销售",
#     "质量",
#     "财务",
#     "设备",
#     "工程",
#     "采购",
#     "人资",
#     "OA",
#     "网络",
#     "体统"
# ]
#
# teams.each do |team|
#   Team.create(:name => team)
# end
